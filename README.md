# E-commerce Product Price Optimization for Sales Velocity

## Overview
This project aims to develop a data-driven model to predict optimal product prices that maximize sales velocity for an e-commerce business. Sales velocity, defined as the rate at which inventory is sold over a given time period, is a critical KPI for e-commerce operations. The project simulates how historical sales data, market trends, and product features can be used to suggest price adjustments, improving upon manual pricing strategies.

## Problem Statement
In e-commerce, manually tweaking prices up and down based on intuition or fixed time frames can be inefficient. This project addresses the question: "How can we use data to systematically determine the optimal price for each product to maximize sales velocity?"
